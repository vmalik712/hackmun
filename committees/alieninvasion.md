A message from the stars! The year is 2025, and we have deciphered a cryptic message: an advanced extraterrestrial civilization will be arriving in just 365 days. You, the political and economic leaders of America, China, and Russia are independently tasked to respond appropriately. Will we welcome the aliens with open arms? Or will we meet them with force? Will the countries collaborate, or seek to doom the other two? The fate of humanity rests on your shoulders.
