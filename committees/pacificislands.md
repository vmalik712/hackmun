In the past few decades, our world has begun to experience the catastrophic effects of climate change. Marked by an increase in natural disasters, arctic melting, and subsequent rise in sea levels, there is no doubt that the destruction caused by global warming will accelerate past a point of no return. Climate change has already had tangible effects on coastal and island communities throughout the world, namely the Pacific Island Countries (PICs). These nations are at imminent risk of being completely submerged underwater in the next few decades. In this committee, delegates will debate the effectiveness and implementation of new climate policies, create plans for relocation of Pacific Islanders, and consider the economic effects of the “dispersion” of Pacific Islanders to other nations.
